# 🎤 AI Meetup Script — Sathya Sai

---

> **Hello guys, good evening to all!**  
> I am **Sathya Sai**, a **3rd-year student in AI and ML**.

> First of all, I would like to thank you all for being here for this **East Meetup**.

---

## 🚀 Today’s Focus

> Today I’ll be showing you **three tools** that cover **design, coding, and creativity**.

---

## 🧑‍🎨 Tool 1: Lovable.dev

> So let's start with **Lovable.dev**

This tool is like having a designer friend who works 24/7 and doesn’t charge you, your lifetime earnings. You just need to tell it,  
*‘I want a portfolio with a dark theme, about page, contact form, and maybe a blog section, ......’* and you also need to give it your all details which you want to be mentioned in that site.

> And **boom** — in minutes or even some times in seconds it builds a full website.

- Want to add filters? → Just type it.
- Want to integrate a payment gateway? → Ask for it.
- It instantly writes and updates the code behind the scenes.

> And if you want any changes to be made, just tell it to edit and it is gonna go ahead and do those changes.

### 🔌 Integrations:

• **GitHub** - for version control of your code  
• **Supabase** - for database integration  
• **Stripe** - for payments  
• **Figma** - for importing design and truning them into websites.  
• And apart from this it has many other integrations like **d3.js, 3.js** etc.

> It is an amazing web dev tool, which makes a stunning UI, but the functionality is something which is needed to be improved. And you can also guide it to proceed adding the backend or functionality to it. But in overall for a portfolio site it is an amazing tool to check out.

> *Here’s a portfolio I generated using the lovable, (after showing it) and you can do it by using this tool.*

---

> But **their's a problem**. **Lovable halusinates** alot when instructed be make something which is backend heavy.


## GitHub Copilot

> And for such real devs, **GitHub Copilot** is a **lifesaver**.

> So we just made a portfolio right? If we want to edit something, then we can simply `git clone` it, then proceed making some real code changes in it.

> And unlike lovable it is not limited to just web dev, but can actually make:
- mobile apps
- terminal based tools
- extensions
- and many more.

> And in simple terms, **GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant**.

> So yeah, you guys can use it in:
- `jetbrains ides`
- `neovim`
- `atermiank based ide`
- and in `vs code`

> So I am gonna use it in `vs code` for now.

> So let's give it a small task at which many tools really suck —  
> let's tell it to make a chess application.

> And also considering the time, let's tell it to make a **terminal based chess app** using `python` and `chess library` *(gonna prompt it)*.

> *(After sometime)* So yeah it looks like it did it. Let's check it.

> And this is looks decent according to what we have instructed.

> We can develop it even further and make it an full blown application with **GUI**.

> And in this way it's use cases are many more.

> And for seamless continuous experience you can select the **agent** in the chat mode.

> And for some more advanced tasks you can connect the **MCP** and let the agent use tools that it needs without any manual intervention.

> *(2 secs of pause)*

## 🎨 LMArena.ai — Creativity & Benchmarking

> And so yeah, that's the thing.

> And now let's look into a tool which is fun to use, to see the benchmarks and is something to do with creativity.

> Which is **Lmarena.ai**

> **LMArena** lets you do two super cool things:

### 🖼️ 1. Generate Images

> Just give it a detailed description — say,  
> *‘A futuristic AI-powered classroom where robots are teaching humans’* —  
> and it will create a decent-quality image in seconds.

> And the best part — you can make it happen **btw two diff LLM's**, kinda like a battle btw them.

### ⚔️ 2. Run Text Battles

> You can pit two AI models against each other in a debate or challenge. For example:  
> *“Claude vs chatGPT — who would win in a better code generation?”*

> And they’ll actually try to one-up each other in real-time.

> And more than this, this tool is super useful to:
- benchmark AI models
- compare reasoning abilities
- and most importantly — **to have fun**

> Let me quickly show you a demo.  
> *(Generate an image or run a small text battle live — something simple and funny, like Batman vs Iron Man.)*

> So yeah, this is a great tool if you want to experiment with multiple AI models at once.

> The limit of choosing models at the same time is **2**, but I think thats fine for the most of the cases.

> And if you really want to use **3 model replies** at the same time, then you can go with **langDB.ai** as surya explained about it.

## 📝 Summary

> *“So to summerize,*  

> **Lovable.dev** — to design and generate portfolios and websites  
> **GitHub Copilot** — to write and edit code like a pro  
> **LMArena.ai** — to explore creativity and benchmark models in a fun way

---

## 💡 Key Takeaway

> The most important thing is to give a **detailed prompt** that clearly communicates your intention to the **LLM**.

> The better your communication with the model, the better its output will be.

> *(After 2 secs of pause)*

## 🙏 Closing

> And Thank you all for listening — and now, if you have questions, I would be very grateful to answer them.

> *(After 4 secs of pause)*

> Okay, thank you for this opportunity and I handover to **eknadh**.
